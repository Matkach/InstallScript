# [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com "Odoo's Homepage") Install Script

Automated interactive bash script for installing Odoo.

This script is based on the installation script of Yenthe V.G (https://github.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript)
Inspired by his work I have created similar interactive script for automated Odoo installation on both CentOS and Ubuntu servers. 

## Installation procedure

##### 1. Download the script:
```
sudo https://github.com/Matkach/install_Odoo/blob/Odoo/install_odoo.sh
```

#### 2. Make the script executable
```
sudo chmod +x odoo_install.sh
```
##### 3. Execute the script:
```
sudo ./odoo_install.sh
```
<b>Please note:</b> The script is only tested on a clean server and is still in a development mode.
